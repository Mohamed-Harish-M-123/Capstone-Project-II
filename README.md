# Capstone-Project-II
# ML Regression Project - TED Talks Views Prediction

## Project Title:

### TED Talk Views Prediction

## Project Description:

TED is devoted in spreading powerful ideas on just about any topic. This dataset contains over 4,000 TED talks including transcripts in many languages. Founded in 1984by Richard Salman as a non profit organization that aimed at bringing experts from the fields of technology, entertainment and design together, TED conferences have gone on to become the Mecca of ideas from virtually all walks of life. As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx chapters have published more than 2000 talks for free consumption by the masses and its speaker list boasts of the likes of AI Gore, Jimmy Wales, Sharukh Khan, and Bill Gates. The main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help in predicting views of the video uploaded on the TEDx website.

### Libraries used:
1. Pandas for data manipulation and aggregation.
2. Matplotlib and seaborn for visualization and behaviour with respect to target variable.
3. NumPy for computationally efficient operations.
4. Scikit Learn for model training, model optimization, and metrics calculation.
